#clarifying notation:
#when we perform the integral, we are integrating with respect to xhat for one specific value of x.
#xhat are basically the x values that are in a certain radius away from x.
#xhat is a displacement vector representing the relative position between two interacting cells
#therefore for all x values we need to compute this integral (i think)
#the integral is a nonlocal integral that aggregates information about the cell density n in a neighborhood of x ([xâˆ’rho,x+rho])
#so when we have n(x+xhat, t) in the integral, we are basically just integrating over a neighboring region.



#h(x) does not depend on time so we can calculate those values once and use them throughtout.
