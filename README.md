# Mathematical Modeling Project: Modelling Epidermal Wound Healing

### Biological Background
Wound healing is divided into three main stages: inflammation, wound closure, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix in scar tissue. 

In an epidermal (outer skin) wound, wound closure is entirely due to epidermal migration -- closure occurs gradually as cells divide and move toward the center of the wound. Consequently, soon after epidermal migration begins, mitotic activity increases. 

Although the reason for this increase in mitotic activity is still unknown, predictions include the absence of contact inhibition, i.e. the mechanism by which cells regulate their movement and stop migrating when they come into contact with other cells, a change in cell shape leading to an increase in the rate of division, or the presence of a mitotic activator/the absence of an inhibitor. There also exists experimental evidence that epidermal cells produce chemicals that inhibit mitosis and chemicals that stimulate it.
